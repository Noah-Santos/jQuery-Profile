                <p><span id="title">Summer Trip To Hawaii In 2022</span><br><br> Me and my family went to Hawaii in the summer of 2022. It was super fun going to the beaches and eating a bunch of food, especially fish. We went to Maui and the Big Island for one week each. We went snorkeling and saw a bunch of eels, fish, and turtles. We went to the tide pools to look for octopus, but didn't see any. We found a molted lobster shell though, so that was fun. We collected a lot of shells and sea urchin spikes, which added to our collection. At almost every beach, I found a rock that was in the shape of a chair, so I obviously took a picture of me sitting in all of them. Another fun story was that I kept accidentally stepping in holes underwater and would fall face first into the ocean. Unfortunately, that always happened when I was about to get out of the water, but just couldn't.</p>
